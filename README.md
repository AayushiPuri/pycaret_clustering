# Clustering
Comparitive performance study of different clustering algorithms using different pre-processing techniques with different numbers of clusters on different evaluation parameters
# clustering 
In this assignment we had to perform different clustering algorithms using different pre-processing techniques with different numbers of clusters on different evaluation parameters.

I have used Pycaret in this assignment.

The dataset that I have used is Wine  Dataset.

The three clustering techniques I have used are:
1. K means Clustering
2. Hierarchical Clustering
3. K means Shift 

The Parameters I have taken are:
1. Silhouette
2. Calinski-Harabasz
3. Davies-Bouldin

The Pre-Processing techniques I have used are:
1. Normalization
2. PCA (Principle Component Analysis)
3. Transform
